# hello-world
It's Lif (leef) Alpha here. 
Let's make a mess - and then fix it. 

Storage for random code, comments and potential projects. 

First project notes
Program for compiling and/or storing and translating junk code or incomplete projects
Later options - can the program eventually go through and prioritize code scraps for various use cases?
What is needed to give it sufficient intelligence to support user with enough personality that the user benefits not just from the base functions of compiling/storing/etc but also wants to use the program for learning/ease/etc.
